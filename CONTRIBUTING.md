# Contributing

We're really happy to accept contributions from the community, that's the main reason why we open-sourced it! There are many ways to contribute, even if you're not a technical person.

We're using the simplified [Github workflow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) to accept modifications, basically you'll have to:

- create an issue related to the problem you want to fix or feature to add (good for traceability and cross-reference)
- fork the repository
- create a branch (optionally with the reference to the issue in the name)
- make any change that you consider
- commit incrementally with readable and detailed commit messages
- submit a pull-request against the master branch of this repository

We'll take care of tagging your issue and answer as soon as possible to the problem you encounter or your feature, via the issue or PR.

If you're not familiar with open-source workflows or our set of technologies, do not hesitate to ask for help!

## Submitting bugs and code
You can report issues directly on Github. 

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Please also make sure your code compiles, passes the tests and the checkstyle configured for this repository.

Describe the PR content and don't hesitate to add comments to explain us why you've added or changed something.
