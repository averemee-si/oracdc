*solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* reads changes from redo log files directly without using any additional software installed on the database server or in the Oracle database itself.

= Oracle Database connections
The connector requires a connection to an Oracle database. This connection is used for two purposes:

1. Reading information about table column data types and table key fields. We are exploring the possibility of eliminating these queries and using only the pre-entered description of table columns and keys in the Schema Registry. If you need this functionality urgently, please contact us at oracle@a2.solutions.
2. Reading the current database SCN and the topology of archived and online redo files.

To define this connection you need to set the following parameters

[width="100%",cols="<27%,<6%,<67%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter Name |Type |Description

|a2.jdbc.url |String|Oracle Database JDBC URL. For more information please refer to https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/jajdb/[Connect using the Oracle JDBC driver]

|a2.jdbc.username |String |JDBC connection username.

|a2.jdbc.password |String |JDBC connection password.
|===


= Selecting the operating mode

== Online redo log processing
With default settings, *solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* processes only archived redo log files.
To process online redo log files and achieve minimal lag between the time a transaction is committed to the database and its processing, you need to set the following parameters:
[width="100%",cols="<20%,<10%,<70%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter Name |Value |Description

|a2.process.online.redo.logs | true | Mandatory setting

|a2.scn.query.interval.ms | Integer | Optional, Minimum time in milliseconds to determine the current SCN during online redo log processing. Default - 60,000 (one minute).
|===


== Memory management
*solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* supports both https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/heap-and-heap-memory.html[On-Heap and Off-Heap memory] (the latter is the default mode). To specify the type of memory used, you need to set *a2.transaction.implementation* parameter to the appropriate value:

* *ChronicleQueue* - default value, this mode uses https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue[Chronicle Queue] to store Oracle Database transactions in Off-Heap memory. We are preparing for the transition to Java 25 and are considering replacing https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue[Chronicle Queue] with the new memory management features such as https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/foreign/MemorySegment.html[MemorySegment] introduced in Java 25.
* *ArrayList* - this mode uses https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html[ArrayList] to store Oracle Database transactions in Heap memory.

If you are using heap memory, you set the initial capacity of the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html[ArrayList] using
|===
|Parameter Name |Value |Description

|a2.array.list.default.capacity | Integer | Optional, initial capacity of https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html[ArrayList] storing Oracle Database transaction data. Default - 32.

|===




== Large objects processing
In the default configuration, large objects

* BLOB
* CLOB
* NCLOB
* https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf/Data-Types.html#GUID-8EFA29E9-E8D8-40A6-A43E-954908C954A4[extended RAW, VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2]
* XMLTYPE
* JSON
* VECTOR

are not processed. To process them, you must set the following parameters:
|===
|Parameter Name |Value |Description

|a2.transaction.implementation | ChronicleQueue | Mandatory setting

|a2.process.lobs | true | Mandatory setting

|===

Please remember to set Apache Kafka parameters according to the required large objects size:

* For Source connector - `producer.max.request.size`
* For Kafka broker/controller - `replica.fetch.max.bytes` and `message.max.bytes`

We plan to provide large object support for Oracle Database transactions stored in https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html[ArrayList] in CY2026.

== Oracle RAC
With default settings, *solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* works with single Oracle Database instance.
To change this and work with https://www.oracle.com/database/real-application-clusters/[Oracle RAC], you need to set the following parameters:
[width="100%",cols="<20%,<10%,<70%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter Name |Value |Description

|a2.use.rac | true | Mandatory setting

|===
When *a2.use.rac* is set to true *solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* first attempts to determine whether this is an https://www.oracle.com/database/real-application-clusters/[Oracle RAC] connection by querying the fixed table https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/refrn/V-ACTIVE_INSTANCES.html[V$ACTIVE_INSTANCES]. If database is not https://www.oracle.com/database/real-application-clusters/[Oracle RAC], only the warning message is printed. Otherwise, additional checks are performed, and *solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* starts a separate Kafka Connect task for each redo thread/RAC instance. Changes for the same table from different redo threads/RAC instances are delivered to the same topic but to different partition where

----
 <KAFKA_PARTITION_NUMBER> = <THREAD#> - 1
----


= Methods for reading redo log files

*solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* can read files located both on the file system and on the Oracle ASM.
The reading method is managed by the *a2.storage.media* parameter. The table below shows its possible values

[width="100%",cols="<30%,<70%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter Value |Description

|FS |Default value, redo files will be read from the local file system.

=== Reading using BFILENAME() function

With this reading method, *solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* reads files using https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf/CREATE-DIRECTORY.html[directory objects]. To transfer changes, the connection described by parameters *a2.jdbc.url*,  *a2.jdbc.username*, and *a2.jdbc.password* is used.
To use https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf/CREATE-DIRECTORY.html[directory objects] correctly, you must disable the use of https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/admin/using-oracle-managed-files.html[Oracle Managed Files]. Consult the Oracle Database documentation or simply run the command
----
alter system set "_omf" = disabled scope=spfile;
----
and restart the database.
Next, you need to create two https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf/CREATE-DIRECTORY.html[directory objects]: one that points to the directory where the online redo logs are located, and one that points to the directory where the archived redo logs are stored.
For example

----
create or replace directory CDC_ONLINE as '/oradata/online';
create or replace directory CDC_ARCHIVE as '/oradata/archive';
----

For https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/[Amazon RDS for Oracle]

----
begin
  RDSADMIN.RDSADMIN_MASTER_UTIL.CREATE_ONLINELOG_DIR; 
  RDSADMIN.RDSADMIN_MASTER_UTIL.CREATE_ARCHIVELOG_DIR;
end;
/
----
This will create ONLINELOG_DIR and ARCHIVELOG_DIR directories used to reference physical redo and archive log files.
After this, you must grant read permissions to the created https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf/CREATE-DIRECTORY.html[directory objects] to the user specified by the parameter *a2.jdbc.username*

=== Direct file access
Although this redo log file access method is the default and seemingly requires no additional configuration, it assumes that:
* or *solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* is installed on the database server
* or the file system containing the redo log files is mounted on the server where *solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* is running.
Both cases, in our opinion, represent significant changes to the system landscape and are not recommended for production work.
To work in this mode you need to set the following parameters

[width="100%",cols="<20%,<10%,<70%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter Name |Value |Description

|a2.storage.media | FS | Mandatory setting

|a2.redo.filename.convert||Optional, it converts the filename of a redo log to another path. It is specified as a string in the <ORIGINAL_PATH>=<NEW_PATH> format. If not specified (default), no conversion occurs. You need to set the parameter value if the path in V$LOGFILE and V$ARCHIVED_LOG differs from the path on the file system.

|===

== Redo logs in the Oracle ASM

=== Direct ASM access

*solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* calls DBMS_DISKGROUP internal https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/rac/asm.html[Oracle ASM] API to read redo logs in https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/rac/asm.html[Oracle ASM]. *solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* does not create, update, or delete any objects during the https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/rac/asm.html[Oracle ASM] access.

To work in this mode you need to set the following parameters

|===


*IMPORTANT* The user defined by *a2.asm.username* parameter must have sufficient privileges on the Oracle ASM instance - sysdba or sysasm.

=== Reading using DBMS_FILE_TRANSFER and BFILENAME

This reading method extends the reading method described above using the BFILENAME() function and at first you need to perform the same actions as for it, that is

To use https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf/CREATE-DIRECTORY.html[directory objects] correctly, you must disable the use of https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/admin/using-oracle-managed-files.html[Oracle Managed Files]. Consult the Oracle Database documentation or simply run the command
----
alter system set "_omf" = disabled scope=spfile;
----

With some configuration you also need to run

----
alter system reset db_recovery_file_dest scope=spfile;
----

and restart the database.

Next, you need to create three https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf/CREATE-DIRECTORY.html[directory objects]: one that points to the directory where the online redo logs are located, one that points to the directory where the archived redo logs are stored, that points to the database server file system that will be used as a staging area for the redo log files that are currently being processedю
For example

----
create or replace directory CDC_ONLINE as '+DATA/ASMTST/ONLINELOG';
create or replace directory CDC_ARCHIVE as '+DATA/ASMTST/ARCHIVE';
create or replace directory CDC_STAGE as '/var/tmp/stage';
----

After this, you must grant required permissions to the created https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf/CREATE-DIRECTORY.html[directory objects] to the user specified by the parameter *a2.jdbc.username*
----
grant read on directory CDC_ONLINE to <a2.jdbc.username>;
grant read on directory CDC_ARCHIVE to <a2.jdbc.username>;
grant read,write on directory CDC_STAGE to <a2.jdbc.username>;
----
After this you must set the value for the following parameters

When set to `dynamic` *solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* builds list of objects to process on the fly
|===

The *%* wildcard character can be used for *a2.include* and *a2.exclude*.

== Selecting table keys

The selection of a key for a table is controlled using the parameters listed below.

[width="100%",cols="<20%,<10%,<70%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter Name |Value |Description
|a2.pk.type |String |When set to `well_defined` the key fields are the table's https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/cncpt/data-integrity.html#GUID-E1033BB9-0F67-4E59-82AC-B8B572FD82BB[primary key] columns or, if the table does not have a https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/cncpt/data-integrity.html#GUID-E1033BB9-0F67-4E59-82AC-B8B572FD82BB[primary key], the table's https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/cncpt/data-integrity.html#GUID-077C26A1-49C3-4E72-AE1D-7CEDD997917A[unique key] columns in which all columns are https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/cncpt/data-integrity.html#GUID-CF2E06A6-6A35-46CE-808E-305A459457CC[NOT NULL].  If there are no appropriate keys in the table, *solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcRedoMinerConnector* uses the `a2.use.rowid.as.key` parameter and generates a pseudo key based on the row's https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/sqlrf/ROWID-Pseudocolumn.html[ROWID], or generates a schema without any key fields.
When set to `_any_unique_` and the table does not have a https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/cncpt/data-integrity.html#GUID-E1033BB9-0F67-4E59-82AC-B8B572FD82BB[primary key] or a https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/cncpt/data-integrity.html#GUID-077C26A1-49C3-4E72-AE1D-7CEDD997917A[unique key] with all https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/cncpt/data-integrity.html#GUID-CF2E06A6-6A35-46CE-808E-305A459457CC[NOT NULL] columns, then the key fields will be the https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/cncpt/data-integrity.html#GUID-077C26A1-49C3-4E72-AE1D-7CEDD997917A[unique key] columns which may have https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/cncpt/glossary.html#GUID-8854502F-2B8F-4ABC-98FA-BBFC3695A964l[NULL] columns.

== Overriding data type mappings

You can override Oracle NUMBER data type definition using parameter

[width="100%",cols="<20%,<10%,<70%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter Name |Value |Description
|a2.number.map.[PDB_NAME.]SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME.COL_NAME_OR_PATTERN| String| Overrides the Kafka data type for an Oracle column with data type NUMBER. The `%` symbol can be used as a control sign in the column name, its use is supported as a start symbol (i.e. the column name ends with) and as a terminal symbol (i.e. the column name begins with). Possible values of data types:

- BOOL, BOOLEAN 
- BYTE, TINYINT
- SHORT, SMALLINT
- INT, INTEGER
- LONG, BIGINT
- FLOAT
- DOUBLE
- DECIMAL([P],S), NUMERIC([P],S)

= Before and after values

By default, the topic is sent data that contains only the data

* for INSERT and UPDATE, after the operation
* for DELETE, before the operation.

To receive both before and after data in the topic, you need to set the parameter
[width="100%",cols="<20%,<10%,<70%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter Name |Value |Description
|a2.schema.type | `debezium` | 
|===

You can also filter and not process UPDATE statements that do not actually change the data, for example,

----
update DEPT set DNAME=DNAME where DEPTNO=10
----

To do this, you must set the parameter
|===
|Parameter Name |Value |Description

|a2.process.all.update.statements | `false` |
